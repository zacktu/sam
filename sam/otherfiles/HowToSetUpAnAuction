This is the way to set up a test or real auction.  There's a faster
way to set up just a test database, but that's not what this file
is for.


Run the SetUpAuction program as as root:
python SetUpAuction(gotta get these in order: '<PORT>', 'root', 'rootspw', 
'localhost', '<AUCTIONDB>')

At this point you have an auction database with empty tables: Donors, Items,
Buyers, Auction.

Login to MySql as root:
mysql -u root -prootspw

Create a user for the auction:
mysql> use mysql;
mysql> INSERT INTO user (Host,User,Password) VALUES('%','<username>',
PASSWORD('password'));
mysql> flush privileges; 

Grant privileges on the auction database to the user:
mysql> GRANT DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE ON '<AUCTIONDB>'.* 
TO '<username>'@'localhost';
mysql> flush privileges; 

The database should be ready for an auction.  All the users will have the same 
username and password.

How to create a csv file from command line using ! to replace tab.
The character following \t in the sed command replaces tab.
Note that you can't replace tab with comma because the addresses 
contain commas.  Maybe semicolon would be a better separator.

mysql -u bob -pbobspw test05 -e "select * from Donors" | sed 's/\t/!/g' > fname.csv

Can read the resulting file with Libre Office if you set it to use ! as
the separation character.

Here is how to get the column names from a table:

select column_name, column_type from information_schema.columns where table_schema = DATABASE() and table_name = "Buyers";
