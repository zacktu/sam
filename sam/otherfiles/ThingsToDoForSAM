Things to do for SAM:

1.		DONE Print all the stuff in Console with separate programs launched by python.
2.		SORT OF DONE investigate concerns about ./tmpfile.  In an multiuser environment probably need unique name for each instance.   BUT NOW IT IS BLOCKING.  DID THIS HAPPEN BEFORE?
3.		Make an Exit button.
4.		Make nice printing for summaries, thank you letters, amount sold, etc.
5.      This works for printing landscape: groff -ms -t -f H -Tps -l -P-l tmp-c2GLU05sxxx
        but I can't get it to work for preview with -X instead of -l.
        but I can get it to work by writing a file instead of using X and then
        using gs on the file produced by groff, i.e.,
        groff <<<parms & file>>> > outfile; gs outfile.
6.      Specific commands are:
            groff -ms -t -f H -Tps -rPO=1.25i -rLL=9i -P-l myfile > junk; gs junk    (console preview)
            groff -ms -t -f H -Tps -l -rPO=1.75i -rLL=9i -P-l myfile		     (laser printer)
        where myfile is a file formatted for groff by sam.  Don't understand PO
